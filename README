Goal :

    Soundective is a web based Music Player capable of deal with your personnal music collection
    Listen files, organize, search for more informations on internet, etc...
    Like Deezer/Spotify at home
    But in difference, I want to make these services bi-directionals : All new informations found on your songs can be rewrite in the file. 

Next steps :

    - Show a scrollable column with all available properties of songs (covert image, etc...)
    - Refactor Builders with more Types (Change mp3agic library?)
    - Fulltext search
    - Keep code coverage nice
