Purpose of this project :

   - Have fun
   - Learn Scala, Javascript, MongoDB and more, and more...

Goal :

    Soundective is web based Music Player capable of deal with your personnal music collection
    Listen files, organize, search for more informations on internet, etc...
    Like Deezer/Spotify at home
    But in difference, I want to make these services bi-directionals : All new informations found on your songs can be rewrite in the file. 

Next steps :

    - Show realtime informations on the database initialisation
    - Show a scrollable column with all available properties of songs (covert image, etc...)
    - Refactor Builders with more Types (Change mp3agic library?)
    - Keep code coverage nice

Usage :

    - Install Play ! Framework
    - Install Scala Module : play install scala
    - Extract files
    - Adapt soundective.song.directory property in conf/application.conf if you want
    - Then type : play run
    - And your application will be available at http://localhost:9000
